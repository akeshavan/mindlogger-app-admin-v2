<h2>Introduction</h2>\n          <p>This User Guide describes four different roles for\n          interacting with Mindlogger.\n          Let's imagine that you want to use mobile devices\n          to collect voice and survey data\n          from a group of participants in a \"Speech Study\".\n          You would first register on the\n          <a href=\"https://app.mindlogger.info\">app.mindlogger.info</a> website,\n          then find or create the \"Speech Study\" applet.\n          As a manager of the \"Speech Study\" applet, you would assign people\n          to different roles:\n          <br><br>\n          <span class=\"text-danger\">User</span>:\n              \"I get notifications on my phone to take the Speech Study survey\n
